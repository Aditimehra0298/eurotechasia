### 1. Network Connectivity Problems
- **Error**: `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`
- **Cause**: Your internet connection is down
- **Affected Resources**:
  - External video from OpenAI servers
  - External images from emitech.fr and kamelo.com.au

### 2. React DevTools Warning

- **Status**: This is just a development suggestion, not an error

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Offline Detection

- Graceful fallback for external resources

### ✅ Local Fallbacks
- Updated Services component to use local images as fallbacks
- Updated Hero component to handle video loading errors
- Added error handling for external resources

### ✅ React DevTools

- Run `npm install` to install the dependency

## How to Fix

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Check Internet Connection
- Ensure your internet connection is stable
- Try refreshing the page when online

### 3. Development Mode
- The React DevTools warning will disappear once you install the dependencies
- You can also install the browser extension for better debugging

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: 
- Offline detection and notification
- Local fallbacks for external resources
- Error handling for failed resource loading

⚠️ **Pending**: 
- Install React DevTools (run `npm install`)
- Restore internet connection for full functionality

## Testing

1. **Offline Mode**: The app will work with local resources
2. **Online Mode**: All external resources will load properly
3. **Mixed Mode**: Local fallbacks will be used when external resources fail

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to complete the setup
2. Restore your internet connection
3. Refresh the page to see all resources load properly

The app is now more resilient to network issues and will provide a better user experience even when offline.
